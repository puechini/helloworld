This is my first repository.  
Hello there.  My name is Matt Fisher.  I have been working at UNCG for 10 years.  I've been wanting to get better with Raspberry Pi for some time now.  I'm even a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator, for that's worth.
I'm looking forward to building some new devices with the Raspberry Pi.
